bagpack
=======

See the [example](http://maximeh.github.com/bagpack)

A very small website to track down all the places I have ever visited in the world.
Just fork the project and add features if you want to !

Actually, you just edit locations.txt and the address of the new location.
The only limitation is one address per line.

Note : You don't need any fancy stuff for this to work, a web browser not too old :)
